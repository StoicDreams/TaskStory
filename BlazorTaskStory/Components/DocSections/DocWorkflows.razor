		Modern companies, teams, and software developers need tools and standards that will help them properly organize and manage their software developement so they get to solving problems and delivering solutions with shorter development cycles and better user experiences.
	</BUIParagraph>
	<BUIParagraph>
		Task Story helps teams achieve this by organizing the development workflow to start with defining problems that need to be solved, with an emphasis on defining the problem, and not worrying at that time about any solutions. This allows those defining problems more focus on declaring a well-defined problem while freeing their mind to not be concerned about solutions.

		Ownership is an important concept in continuous agile development that plays an important role in driving iterative development with short release cycles.
	</BUIParagraph>
	<BUIParagraph>
		Each part of the workflow (Project, Feature, Problem, Solution, Task) only has one owner at any given time, but ownership can move around to different people during its progress towards completion. A single owner does not necessitate only one person is working on a part at any one time. The purpose of the single owner principal is to dictate that a single person is taking lead and ownership of the work being done. This person is the ultimate decision maker for that part of the work, but should factor in their teams discussions, facts, and opinions when determining directions to take when deciding how to complete the work.

			When someone declares a new problem in Task Story. They are the initial owner of that problem. They are responsible for providing details over who is having a problem, what the problem is, where the problem is occurring, when is the problem occurring, why is this a problem, and how this problem can be replicated.
		</BUIParagraph>
		<BUIParagraph>
			When a developer is going to work on a problem, they will take ownership over the problem. It is now their responsibility to investigate the problem, evaluate and document potential solutions, perform any prototyping, testing, and benchmarking if needed, and ultimately decide on and implement the best solution based on their findings.

			When defining a new project, you may or may not want to define some key features from the start.
		</BUIParagraph>
		<BUIParagraph>
			This will vary depending on the type of project and how much thought has been given to it at this point. When defining at the start, limit details to very abstract explenations.
		</BUIParagraph>
		<BUIParagraph>
			Features should be continuously added and updated throughout development. Adding new feature documentation as solutions are implementing them for the first time, and updating existing feature documentation when solution implementations are applicable to them.

			The project owner is responsible for prioritizing problems within their project.
		</BUIParagraph>
		<BUIParagraph>
			Prioritization should be a general guide, but developers should not be restrained by this prioritization. There could be technical reasons the project owner is not aware of that necessitates a different priority. The developer could see 2 separate problems as being related and want to tackle them both at the same time, even though their priorities are widely different.
		</BUIParagraph>
		<BUIParagraph>
			If a developer needs to change prioritization, they should communicate this to the project owner to make the change, or communicate the change being made.
